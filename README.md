Hello there!
Welcome to the Barbie Earbuds!
This project explores innovative concepts for a new pair of earbuds and their charging case. The primary goal is to model, texture, light, and animate these earbud designs using Cinema 4D. The resulting assets will be used as resources on a promotional website, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.
